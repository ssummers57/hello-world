# hello-world
This is a repository used mainly for testing things and gaining experience.
I am training to become a test engineer.

Historically I have worked in software testing, initially in telecoms but, most recently, in government. I have been testing for about 18 years. I am currently engaged on a project where the testing is predominantly automated. We use Cucumber for designing BDD scenarios and we code in Ruby.

I have also done some Python, Perl and Java.
